            Criminal Justice major born in Brooklyn, New York I have alway had in interest in Psychology and upon entering college decided to pursue it. However, the field proved to long to venture into and I wanted something that would give me more versatility.
            I swithced over to Criminal Justice in the hopes of becoming a lawyer. For awhile I beleived that this is what I wanted to do. Picturing myself working with other attorney and being a kind of public hero was an image I relished in, however,
            this was met with reality when I worked in the court system and found it to be less than glamouras.
            <br><br> Slighty defeated I found a common denominator with every position I've always held. I loved tinkering with computers, since I was young this was true. I have strong creative side I have always loved to create thing whether it be drawing
            or taking things apart and putting them together to see how they work. I would often write in my free time. I finally found coding and found it to be an exciting field I found a way to to utilize my create side while also satisfying my desire
            to see the inner workings of alot of technology we use today. With this new field at my finger I decide to self teach myself and eventually moved on to join rutgers bootcamp. Where I will realize my dream of becoming a web developer and allow
            the world to what I will create.
